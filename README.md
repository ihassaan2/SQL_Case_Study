# SQL_Case_Study
SQL Data Exploration on a real life start up in Silicon Valley. 

Objective 

The objective of this project is to demonstrate my ability in using SQL
I have used Postgres SQL to query the data in the main file

Data in this project is dummy data. The original data items have been removed due to confidentiality.


The Case Study:

The Software product is a non-profit platform that helps non-profit organizations to search for funders for grant awards, track outcome based impact, tell and share stories of impact, and access resources and training courses. 

The SSAS startup wants to track usage across their app to use data-driven insights to improve their app, hence grow their business.
They do this by using front-end tracking of their app. The data tracked makes its way to the data warehousing platform - snowflake

As the User navigates the app , click/view based events tell us:
- Who the user is
- What action they complete
- When they take the action
- How the action was completed

I have used this data to answer important questions that help the business better it's product. My data-driven insights should directly impact the growth of this start up. 

These queries can be found in the main .sql file
